1) Always provide a typedef for algorithms such as:
copy<>::type -> copy_t<>
find<>::type -> find_t<>

2) Pass numbers via integral wrappers
instead of:
template <unsigned i> struct {};

do:
template <typename i> struct {};

3) Predicates have to provide an apply member template and not have any template parameters.
