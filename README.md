# mpl14
A template meta programming library for tuples and strings.

##**Warning: This is still in very very early development and not tested through thoroughly yet**

Examples (as documentation replacement) are planed and will be provided in the future.

Note: this is by no means a replacement for boost::mpl or mpl11 here on github.
Also not likely to be as professionally designed. (No lazy instantiation for example, although most algorithms are short circuiting themselves to prevent deeper instation than necessary).
